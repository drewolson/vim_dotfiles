cvsrelease is a wicked shell script for creating tarballs and/or zips from
CVS.  It is very flexible, allowing arbitrary scripts to be executed on the
temporary export tree before archiving it.  One such application of this would
be the removal of some files from the "stable" version.

release.sh is my wrapper around cvsrelease.  The main benefit is that it
deduces the CVS root from the local working directory.  It contains usage
information.  When required, I will amend this, and add whatever other scripts
are needed, to produce stable and development releases for us.
